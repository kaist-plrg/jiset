This section explains the overall structure of $\tool$ depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:overall}.

\todo

% It consists of four different modules: $\jiset$,
% \name{Step-by-Step Executor}, \name{Partial Evaluator}, and \name{Delta
% Debugger}. First, $\tool$ utilizes another tool called $\jiset$ to extract
% mechanized specification from ECMAScript.  Therefore, it is automatically
% synchronized with a given version of ECMAScript and deals with language
% semantics of the given specification.
% 
% \paragraph{Step-by-Step Execution}
% 
% dependent on a given version of ECMAScript.

% syntax and semantics using $\jiset$ and extracts specification types from

% 
% Our tool is a JavaScript interactive specification
% automatically synchronized with a given version of ECMAScript and supporting
% three different user interactions for better understanding of JavaScript
% language semantics.

% First, it supports \textit{step-by-step program
